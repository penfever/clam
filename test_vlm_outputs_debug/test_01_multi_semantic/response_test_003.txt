Class: 1 | Reasoning: The red star (query point) is consistently closest to the orange-colored class cluster across both PCA and t-SNE visualizations. This suggests that the query point is more aligned with the characteristics of the data from class 1, as evidenced by its proximity to the orange points in both PCA and t-SNE plots.
