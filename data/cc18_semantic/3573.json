  "inference_notes": "Challenges: May be too easy for modern methods, limited complexity compared to real-world problems, only includes digits (not full alphanumeric). Advantages: Well-established benchmark, clean dataset, good for beginners, computationally manageable, extensive literature available. Use Case: Handwritten digit recognition, optical character recognition (OCR), benchmarking machine learning algorithms, educational purposes, deep learning tutorials"
