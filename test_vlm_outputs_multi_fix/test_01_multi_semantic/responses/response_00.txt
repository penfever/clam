Class: 1 | Reasoning: The red star is consistently closest to the class 1 cluster across both PCA and T-SNE visualizations. In PCA, the red star is positioned near the class 1 cluster in the direction of the principal components. In T-SNE, the red star is also near the class 1 cluster, indicating that the query point is more similar to the class 1 data points in the lower-dimensional space.
