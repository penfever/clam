Class: Class_2 | Reasoning: The query point is closer to the cluster of Class_2 points in the t-SNE visualization. Additionally, the pie chart shows that the nearest neighbors to the query point are predominantly from Class_2, with a smaller number of neighbors from Class_3. The relative closeness of the query point to the Class_2 cluster and the higher number of neighbors from Class_2 in the pie chart suggest that Class_2 is the most likely class for the query point.
