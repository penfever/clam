Class: Class_3 | Reasoning: The query point is located near the cluster of points representing Class_3 in the t-SNE visualization. Additionally, the pie chart shows that the nearest neighbors of the query point are predominantly from Class_3, with the average distance to these neighbors being relatively small compared to other classes. This suggests that the query point is most similar to the Class_3 data points.
