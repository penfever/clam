Class: Heuristic 2 fastest | Reasoning: The red star (query point) is closest to the cluster of points representing the "Heuristic 2 fastest" class in the Front View (XZ) and Side View (YZ). In the Isometric View (20° elevation, 45° azimuth), the red star is also near the "Heuristic 2 fastest" class. The Top View (XY) shows the red star in a position that aligns with the "Heuristic 2 fastest" class cluster. Therefore, based on the spatial relationships across all viewing angles, the query point should be classified as "Heuristic 2 fastest."
