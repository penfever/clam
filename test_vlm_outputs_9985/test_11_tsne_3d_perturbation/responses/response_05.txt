Class: Heuristic 2 fastest | Reasoning: The red star (query point) is closest to the cluster of blue points in the Isometric View, which corresponds to the "Heuristic 1 fastest" class. This spatial relationship is consistent across all four views, indicating that the query point is most similar to the "Heuristic 1 fastest" class in terms of the features embedded in the dataset.
