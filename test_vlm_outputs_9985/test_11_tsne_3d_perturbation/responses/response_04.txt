Class: Heuristic 2 fastest | Reasoning: The red star (query point) is closest to the cluster of points representing "Heuristic 2 fastest" in the Front View (XZ) and Side View (YZ). In the Isometric View (20° elevation, 45° azimuth), the red star is also near the "Heuristic 2 fastest" cluster. The Top View (XY) shows the red star in a position that aligns with the "Heuristic 2 fastest" cluster, indicating that the query point is most closely associated with this class across all viewing angles.
