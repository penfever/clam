Class: Heuristic 2 fastest | Reasoning: The red star (query point) is positioned closer to the cluster of points representing "Heuristic 2 fastest" in the Front View (XZ) and Side View (YZ) compared to other classes. In the Isometric View (20° elevation, 45° azimuth), the red star is also relatively close to the "Heuristic 2 fastest" cluster. The Top View (XY) shows the red star slightly above the "Heuristic 2 fastest" cluster, but still within the same general area. This consistent spatial clustering across all views suggests that the red star is most likely associated with the "Heuristic 2 fastest" class.
