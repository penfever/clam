Class: Heuristic 2 fastest | Reasoning: The red star (query point) is closest to the cluster of points representing the "Heuristic 2 fastest" class in the Front View (XZ) and Side View (YZ). In the Isometric View (Elevation=20°, Azimuth=45°), the red star is also relatively close to the "Heuristic 2 fastest" class. The Top View (XY) shows a similar pattern, with the red star being near the "Heuristic 2 fastest" class. Therefore, based on the spatial relationships across all viewing angles, the query point is most likely to belong to the "Heuristic 2 fastest" class.
