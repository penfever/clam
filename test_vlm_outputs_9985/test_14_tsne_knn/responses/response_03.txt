Class: Class_2 | Reasoning: The query point is closer to the cluster of Class_2 neighbors in the t-SNE visualization, and the pie chart shows that Class_2 has the highest number of neighbors (4 out of 5) with the smallest average distance (3.9). This indicates that the query point is more similar to the Class_2 neighbors than to the Class_3 neighbors, which have a higher average distance (9.9).
