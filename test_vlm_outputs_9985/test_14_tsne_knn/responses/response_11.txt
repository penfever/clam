Class: Class_5 | Reasoning: The query point is closer to the test points of Class_5 (4 neighbors) compared to Class_1 (1 neighbor), and the average distance to Class_5 neighbors (16.0) is slightly lower than to Class_1 neighbors (16.7). Additionally, the spatial clustering in the t-SNE visualization shows that Class_5 is more densely populated around the query point, indicating a higher likelihood of the query point belonging to Class_5.
