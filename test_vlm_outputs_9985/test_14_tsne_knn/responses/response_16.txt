Class: Class_4 | Reasoning: The query point is closer to the class 4 neighbors (4 out of 5) and the average distance to class 4 neighbors (8.1) is slightly lower than to class 0 neighbors (8.5). The spatial clustering in the t-SNE visualization also suggests that the query point is more aligned with the class 4 cluster.
