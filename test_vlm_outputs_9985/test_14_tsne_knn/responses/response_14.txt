Class: Class_5 | Reasoning: The query point is surrounded by neighbors from Class_5, and the pie chart shows that all 5 nearest neighbors are from Class_5, with an average distance of 1.9. This indicates that the query point is very close to the majority class in the original high-dimensional embedding space, which is consistent with the t-SNE visualization showing a cluster of points from Class_5.
