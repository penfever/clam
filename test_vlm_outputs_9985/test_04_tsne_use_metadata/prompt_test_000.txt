Looking at this t-SNE visualization of tabular data, you can see:

1. Colored points representing training data, where each color corresponds to a different class
2. Gray square points representing test data  
3. One red star point which is the query point I want you to classify

Class Legend:
- Heuristic 1 fastest: Blue RGB(30, 119, 181)
- Heuristic 2 fastest: Orange RGB(255, 127, 12)
- Heuristic 3 fastest: Green RGB(43, 160, 43)
- Heuristic 4 fastest: Red RGB(214, 38, 40)
- Heuristic 5 fastest: Purple RGB(147, 102, 188)
- Theorem too difficult - decline to prove: Brown RGB(140, 86, 73)
- Test points: Light Gray RGB(211, 211, 211)

Dataset Context: Tabular data embedded using appropriate features 
Dataset: Machine learning dataset for automated theorem proving. Predicts which of five heuristics will give the fastest proof when used by a first-order prover, with a sixth option to decline attempting a proof if the theorem is too difficult. | Key features: Feature 1; Feature 2; Feature 3; Feature 4; Feature 5 | Classes: "1": Heuristic 1 fastest; "2": Heuristic 2 fastest; "3": Heuristic 3 fastest; "4": Heuristic 4 fastest; "5": Heuristic 5 fastest; "6": Theorem too difficult - decline to prove

Based on the position of the red star (query point) relative to the colored training points, which class should this query point belong to? The available classes are: "Heuristic 1 fastest", "Heuristic 2 fastest", "Heuristic 3 fastest", "Heuristic 4 fastest", "Heuristic 5 fastest", "Theorem too difficult - decline to prove"

Consider:
- The spatial relationships in the t-SNE visualization
- Which colored class clusters the red star is closest to or embedded within

Please respond with just the class label (e.g., "Heuristic 1 fastest", "Heuristic 2 fastest", etc.) followed by a brief explanation of your reasoning based on the spatial clustering patterns you observe.

Format your response as: "Class: [class_label] | Reasoning: [brief explanation]"
