Class: Class_5 | Reasoning: The red star is closest to the brown-colored training points, which correspond to Class_5.

=== RESPONSE ===

Class: Class_4 | Reasoning: The red star (query point) is closest to the purple-colored training points, which correspond to Class_4.

=== RESPONSE ===

Class: Class_3 | Reasoning: The red star (query point) is closest to the red-colored training points, which are associated with Class_3.

=== RESPONSE ===

Class: Class_2 | Reasoning: The red star (query point) is closest to the green-colored training points, which suggests that it belongs to Class_2.

=== RESPONSE ===

Class: Class_3 | Reasoning: The red star (query point) is closest to the red-colored class cluster in the t-SNE visualization, indicating that it is most similar to the data points in that class.

=== RESPONSE ===

Class: Class_3 | Reasoning: The red star (query point) is closest to the red-colored class cluster in the t-SNE visualization.

=== RESPONSE ===

Class: Class_2 | Reasoning: The red star is closest to the green-colored training points, indicating that it is embedded within the cluster of Class_2 data.

=== RESPONSE ===

Class: Class_5 | Reasoning: The red star (query point) is closest to the brown-colored training points, which correspond to Class_5.

=== RESPONSE ===

Class: Class_3 | Reasoning: The red star (query point) is closest to the cluster of points representing Class_3, which is colored red. This spatial proximity suggests that the query point is most likely from Class_3.

=== RESPONSE ===

Class: Class_3 | Reasoning: The red star (query point) is closest to the cluster of points representing Class_3, which is the red-colored class.

=== RESPONSE ===

Class: Class_2 | Reasoning: The red star (query point) is closest to the green-colored training points, which are labeled as Class_2. This suggests that the query point is more similar to the training data from Class_2 in the t-SNE visualization.

=== RESPONSE ===

Class: Class_3 | Reasoning: The red star (query point) is closest to the red-colored class cluster in the t-SNE visualization, indicating that it is most similar to the data points in that class.

=== RESPONSE ===

Class: Class_3 | Reasoning: The red star (query point) is closest to the cluster of points representing Class_3, which is the red-colored class.

=== RESPONSE ===

Class: Class_3 | Reasoning: The red star (query point) is closest to the red-colored class points in the t-SNE visualization, indicating that it is most similar to the data points associated with Class_3.

=== RESPONSE ===

Class: Class_2 | Reasoning: The red star (query point) is closest to the green-colored training points, which suggests that it belongs to Class_2 based on the t-SNE visualization.

=== RESPONSE ===

Class: Class_3 | Reasoning: The red star (query point) is closest to the red-colored class cluster in the t-SNE visualization, indicating that it is most similar to the data points associated with Class_3.

=== RESPONSE ===

Class: Class_4 | Reasoning: The red star (query point) is closest to the purple-colored training points, which correspond to Class_4.

=== RESPONSE ===

Class: Class_2 | Reasoning: The red star (query point) is closest to the green-colored training points, which are labeled as Class_2. This suggests that the query point is most likely from Class_2 based on its spatial proximity to the training data points.

=== RESPONSE ===

Class: Class_3 | Reasoning: The red star (query point) is closest to the red-colored class cluster in the t-SNE visualization.

=== RESPONSE ===

Class: Class_5 | Reasoning: The red star (query point) is closest to the brown-colored points, which represent Class_5. The spatial clustering pattern indicates that the query point is embedded within the cluster of Class_5 data points.
