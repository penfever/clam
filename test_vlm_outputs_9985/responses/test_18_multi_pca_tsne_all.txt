Class: Class_5 | Reasoning: The red star is consistently closest to the class 5 cluster across both PCA and t-SNE visualizations. This suggests that the query point is most likely to belong to class 5 based on the spatial relationships observed in both methods.

=== RESPONSE ===

Class: Class_4 | Reasoning: The red star is consistently closest to the class labeled "Class_4" across both PCA and t-SNE visualizations. This suggests that "Class_4" is the most likely class for the query point based on the spatial relationships and patterns observed in both methods.

=== RESPONSE ===

Class: Class_2 | Reasoning: The red star is consistently closest to the class_2 cluster across both PCA and t-SNE visualizations. This suggests that the query point is most similar to the data points in class_2, indicating that class_2 is the most likely classification for the query point.
