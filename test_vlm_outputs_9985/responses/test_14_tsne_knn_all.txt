Additionally, the pie chart shows that Class_1 has the highest number of nearest neighbors (2 out of 5), with an average distance of 12.4, which is the lowest among the classes. This suggests that the query point is most similar to the test points of Class_1.

=== RESPONSE ===

Class: Class_4 | Reasoning: The query point is closer to the test points of Class_4 in the t-SNE visualization, and it has two nearest neighbors from Class_4, which is the highest count among the nearest neighbors.

=== RESPONSE ===

Class: Class_2 | Reasoning: The query point is surrounded by neighbors from Class_2, and the pie chart shows that all 5 nearest neighbors are from Class_2, with an average distance of 10.6. This indicates a strong clustering of Class_2 in the neighborhood, suggesting that the query point is most likely from Class_2.

=== RESPONSE ===

Class: Class_5 | Reasoning: The query point is closer to the test points of Class_5 (4 neighbors) compared to Class_1 (1 neighbor), and the average distance to Class_5 neighbors (16.0) is slightly lower than to Class_1 neighbors (16.7). Additionally, the spatial clustering in the t-SNE visualization shows that Class_5 is more densely populated around the query point, indicating a higher likelihood of the query point belonging to Class_5.

=== RESPONSE ===

Class: Class_5 | Reasoning: The query point is surrounded by neighbors from Class_5, and the pie chart shows that all 5 nearest neighbors are from Class_5, with an average distance of 15.8. This indicates a strong clustering of Class_5 in the neighborhood, suggesting that the query point is most likely from Class_5.

=== RESPONSE ===

Class: Class_5 | Reasoning: The query point is closer to the test points of Class_5 than to the test points of Class_1. Additionally, the pie chart shows that Class_5 has the highest number of neighbors (4 out of 5) with the smallest average distance (16.3), indicating that the query point is more similar to the test points of Class_5.

=== RESPONSE ===

Class: Class_5 | Reasoning: The query point is surrounded by neighbors from Class_5, and the pie chart shows that all 5 nearest neighbors are from Class_5, with an average distance of 1.9. This indicates that the query point is very close to the majority class in the original high-dimensional embedding space, which is consistent with the t-SNE visualization showing a cluster of points from Class_5.

=== RESPONSE ===

Class: Class_2 | Reasoning: The query point is closer to the cluster of Class_2 neighbors (3 neighbors) compared to the other classes. The pie chart shows that Class_2 has the highest percentage (60%) of the nearest neighbors, and the average distance to these neighbors is 14.7, which is lower than the average distance to neighbors of other classes (15.4).

=== RESPONSE ===

Class: Class_4 | Reasoning: The query point is closer to the class 4 neighbors (4 out of 5) and the average distance to class 4 neighbors (8.1) is slightly lower than to class 0 neighbors (8.5). The spatial clustering in the t-SNE visualization also suggests that the query point is more aligned with the class 4 cluster.
