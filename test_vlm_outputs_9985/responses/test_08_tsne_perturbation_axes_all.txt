Class: Heuristic 2 fastest | Reasoning: The red star is closest to the orange-colored points, which represent the "Heuristic 2 fastest" class. The spatial proximity suggests that the query point is more aligned with the characteristics of this class.

=== RESPONSE ===

Class: Heuristic 4 fastest | Reasoning: The red star (query point) is closest to the cluster of points labeled "Heuristic 4 fastest" on the t-SNE visualization. This suggests that the query point is most similar to the data points associated with this heuristic, indicating that it should be classified as "Heuristic 4 fastest."

=== RESPONSE ===

Class: Heuristic 5 fastest | Reasoning: The red star (query point) is closest to the purple-colored points, which represent Heuristic 5 fastest. The spatial clustering suggests that the query point is more aligned with the characteristics of Heuristic 5 fastest.

=== RESPONSE ===

Class: Heuristic 3 fastest | Reasoning: The red star (query point) is closest to the green-colored points, which represent Heuristic 3 fastest. The spatial clustering pattern indicates that the query point is more aligned with the Heuristic 3 fastest class.

=== RESPONSE ===
