Class: Heuristic 2 fastest | Reasoning: The red star is closest to the cluster of orange-colored points, which represent the "Heuristic 2 fastest" class.

=== RESPONSE ===

Class: Heuristic 4 fastest | Reasoning: The red star is closest to the cluster of points representing Heuristic 4 fastest, indicating that the query point is most likely to belong to this class.

=== RESPONSE ===

Class: Heuristic 4 fastest | Reasoning: The red star (query point) is closest to the cluster of points representing Heuristic 4 fastest, as it is positioned near the center of that cluster in the t-SNE visualization.

=== RESPONSE ===

Class: Heuristic 3 fastest | Reasoning: The red star (query point) is closest to the green-colored points, which represent Heuristic 3 fastest. The spatial proximity suggests that the query point is likely to belong to the same class as the majority of the training data for Heuristic 3 fastest.

=== RESPONSE ===

Class: Heuristic 4 fastest | Reasoning: The red star (query point) is closest to the cluster of points representing Heuristic 4 fastest, indicating that it is most likely to belong to this class.

=== RESPONSE ===

Class: Heuristic 4 fastest | Reasoning: The red star (query point) is positioned closer to the cluster of points representing Heuristic 4 fastest, indicating that it is most likely to belong to this class based on its spatial proximity.

=== RESPONSE ===

Class: Heuristic 3 fastest | Reasoning: The red star is closest to the green-colored points, which represent Heuristic 3 fastest.

=== RESPONSE ===

Class: Theorem too difficult - decline to prove | Reasoning: The red star query point is positioned in the region of the t-SNE visualization that is closest to the brown-colored points, which represent the "Theorem too difficult - decline to prove" class. This suggests that the query point is likely to belong to this class.

=== RESPONSE ===

Class: Heuristic 4 fastest | Reasoning: The red star is closest to the cluster of points representing "Heuristic 4 fastest" in the t-SNE visualization. This suggests that the query point is most likely to belong to the class of heuristics that give the fastest proofs.

=== RESPONSE ===

Class: Heuristic 4 fastest | Reasoning: The red star is positioned closer to the cluster of points representing the "Heuristic 4 fastest" class, indicating that the query point is most likely associated with this class.

=== RESPONSE ===

Class: Heuristic 4 fastest | Reasoning: The red star (query point) is positioned closer to the cluster of points representing "Heuristic 4 fastest" than to any other colored class. This suggests that the query point is most likely associated with the fastest heuristic for the given dataset.

=== RESPONSE ===
