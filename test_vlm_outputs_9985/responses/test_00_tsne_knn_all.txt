=== RESPONSE ===

Class: Class_3 | Reasoning: The query point is located near the cluster of Class_3 points in the t-SNE visualization. The pie chart shows that the nearest neighbors to the query point are all from Class_3, with the smallest average distance, indicating high similarity.

=== RESPONSE ===

Class: Class_3 | Reasoning: The query point is closer to the cluster of Class_3 points in the t-SNE visualization. Additionally, the pie chart shows that the nearest neighbors of the query point are all from Class_3, indicating a higher similarity to this class.

=== RESPONSE ===

Class: Class_3 | Reasoning: The query point is closer to the cluster of Class_3 points in the t-SNE visualization and has the closest neighbors among the five nearest neighbors, which are all from Class_3.

=== RESPONSE ===

Class: Class_3 | Reasoning: The query point is located near the cluster of points representing Class_3 in the t-SNE visualization. Additionally, the pie chart shows that the nearest neighbors of the query point are predominantly from Class_3, with the average distance to these neighbors being relatively small compared to other classes. This suggests that the query point is most similar to the Class_3 data points.

=== RESPONSE ===

Class: Class_3 | Reasoning: The query point is located near the cluster of Class_3 points in the t-SNE visualization. Additionally, the nearest neighbors connected by red lines are also from Class_3, indicating a strong similarity. The pie chart shows that Class_3 has the highest number of nearest neighbors, suggesting it is the most likely class for the query point.

=== RESPONSE ===
