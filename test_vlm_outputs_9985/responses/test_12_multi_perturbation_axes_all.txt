Class: "Theorem too difficult - decline to prove" | Reasoning: The red star is consistently closest to the class labeled "Theorem too difficult - decline to prove" across both PCA and t-SNE visualizations. This class appears to be more isolated and distinct in both plots, suggesting it is the most different from the other classes.

=== RESPONSE ===

Class: "Heuristic 2 fastest" | Reasoning: The red star is consistently closest to the class labeled "Heuristic 2 fastest" across both PCA and t-SNE visualizations. This class appears to be the most central and well-separated in both plots, indicating it is the most representative of the query point's classification.
