Class: Class_2 | Reasoning: The red star (query point) is consistently closest to the green-colored class clusters across all three visualization methods (T-SNE, ISOMAP, MDS). This suggests that the query point is most likely to belong to the "Class_2" based on the spatial relationships and patterns observed in the multi-visualization analysis.
