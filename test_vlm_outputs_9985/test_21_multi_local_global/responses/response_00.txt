Class: Class_5 | Reasoning: The red star is consistently closest to the class labeled "Class_5" across all three visualization methods (T-SNE, ISOMAP, MDS). This suggests that the query point is most likely to belong to "Class_5" based on the spatial relationships and patterns observed in the data across these different visualization techniques.
