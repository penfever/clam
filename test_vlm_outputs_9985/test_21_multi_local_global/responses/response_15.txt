Class: Class_5 | Reasoning: The red star (query point) is consistently closest to the class labeled "Class_5" across all three visualization methods (T-SNE, ISOMAP, MDS). This suggests that "Class_5" is the most likely class for the query point based on the spatial relationships and patterns observed in all three visualizations.
