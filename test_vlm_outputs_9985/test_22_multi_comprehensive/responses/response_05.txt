Class: Class_2 | Reasoning: The red star (query point) is consistently closest to the cluster of points labeled as "Class_2" across all four visualization methods. This consistency across different methods suggests that "Class_2" is the most likely class for the query point. The spatial relationships and patterns observed in the visualizations indicate that "Class_2" is the class that the query point is most aligned with, making it the most probable classification.
