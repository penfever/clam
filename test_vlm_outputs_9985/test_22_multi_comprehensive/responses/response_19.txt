Class: Class_2 | Reasoning: The red star (query point) is consistently closest to the cluster of points labeled as "Class_2" across all four visualization methods. This consistency suggests that "Class_2" is the most likely class for the query point. The spatial relationships and patterns observed in the PCA, T-SNE, SPECTRAL, and ISOMAP visualizations all point to "Class_2" as the most appropriate classification for the query point.
