Class: Class_2 | Reasoning: The red star is consistently closest to the cluster of points labeled as "Class_2" across all four visualization methods. This suggests that "Class_2" is the most likely class for the query point. The spatial relationships and patterns observed in the PCA, T-SNE, SPECTRAL, and ISOMAP plots all indicate that "Class_2" is the class that the query point is most aligned with.
