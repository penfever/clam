Class: Class_2 | Reasoning: The red star is consistently closest to the cluster of points labeled as "Class_2" across all four visualization methods. This consistency suggests that the query point is most likely to belong to "Class_2". The spatial relationships and patterns observed in the PCA, T-SNE, SPECTRAL, and ISOMAP plots all indicate that "Class_2" is the most probable class for the query point.
