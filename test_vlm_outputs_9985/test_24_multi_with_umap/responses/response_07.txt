Class: Class_3 | Reasoning: The red star is consistently closest to the cluster of points labeled as "Class_3" across all three visualization methods (PCA, T-SNE, UMAP). This suggests that the query point is most likely to belong to "Class_3" based on the spatial relationships and cluster assignments across the different methods.
