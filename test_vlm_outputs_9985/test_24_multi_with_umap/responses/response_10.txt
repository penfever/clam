Class: Class_2 | Reasoning: The red star is consistently closest to the cluster of points representing "Class_2" across all three visualization methods (PCA, t-SNE, UMAP). This suggests that the query point is most likely to belong to "Class_2" based on the spatial relationships and cluster assignments across the different methods.
