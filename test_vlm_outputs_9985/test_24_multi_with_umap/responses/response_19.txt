Class: Class_5 | Reasoning: The red star (query point) is consistently closest to the cluster of points labeled as "Class_5" across all three visualization methods (PCA, T-SNE, UMAP). This suggests that the query point is most likely to belong to "Class_5" based on the spatial relationships and cluster assignments across these methods.
