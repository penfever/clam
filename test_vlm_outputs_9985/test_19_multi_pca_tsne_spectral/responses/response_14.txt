Class: Class_5 | Reasoning: The red star is consistently closest to the cluster of points representing Class_5 across all three visualization methods (PCA, t-SNE, SPECTRAL). This suggests that the query point is most likely to belong to Class_5 based on the spatial relationships and class clustering observed in all three methods.
