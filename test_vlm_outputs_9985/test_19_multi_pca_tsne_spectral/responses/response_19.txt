Class: Class_5 | Reasoning: The red star (query point) is consistently closest to the class labeled "Class_5" across all three visualization methods (PCA, T-SNE, SPECTRAL). This suggests that "Class_5" is the most likely class for the query point, as it appears to be the most central or representative class in the data across different visualizations.
