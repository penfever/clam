Class: Class_5 | Reasoning: The red star (query point) is consistently closest to the cluster of points representing Class_5 across all three visualization methods (PCA, T-SNE, SPECTRAL). This indicates that the query point is most likely classified as Class_5 based on the spatial relationships and patterns observed in the data across these different representations.
