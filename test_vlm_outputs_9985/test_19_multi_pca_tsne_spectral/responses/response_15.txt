Class: Class_5 | Reasoning: The red star (query point) is consistently closest to the cluster of points representing Class_5 across all three visualization methods (PCA, t-SNE, SPECTRAL). This indicates that the query point is most similar to the data points associated with Class_5, making it the most likely class for the query point.
