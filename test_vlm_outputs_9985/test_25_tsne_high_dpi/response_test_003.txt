Class: Class_3 | Reasoning: The red star (query point) is closest to the green-colored training points, which are labeled as Class_2. However, the spatial relationship suggests that the red star is more aligned with the red-colored training points, which are labeled as Class_3. Therefore, the query point is more likely to belong to Class_3.
