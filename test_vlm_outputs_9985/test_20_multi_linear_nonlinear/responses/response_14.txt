Class: Class_3 | Reasoning: The red star (query point) is consistently closest to the cluster of points representing "Class_3" across all three visualization methods (PCA, T-SNE, ISOMAP). This suggests that "Class_3" is the most likely class for the query point, as it is the class that the red star is most frequently associated with across different visualizations.
