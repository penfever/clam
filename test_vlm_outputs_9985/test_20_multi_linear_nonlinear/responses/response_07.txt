Class: Class_2 | Reasoning: The red star is consistently closest to the cluster of points representing Class_2 across all three visualization methods (PCA, T-SNE, ISOMAP). This suggests that Class_2 is the most likely class for the query point. The spatial relationships and patterns observed in all three methods support this conclusion.
