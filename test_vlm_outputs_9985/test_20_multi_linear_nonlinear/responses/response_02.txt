Class: Class_4 | Reasoning: The red star (query point) is consistently closest to the cluster of points representing "Class_4" across all three visualization methods (PCA, T-SNE, ISOMAP). This suggests that "Class_4" is the most likely class for the query point, as it is the only class that appears to be the most central or representative in all three visualizations.
