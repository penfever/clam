Class: Class_3 | Reasoning: The red star (query point) is consistently closest to the cluster of points labeled as "Class_3" across all three visualization methods (PCA, T-SNE, ISOMAP). This suggests that "Class_3" is the most likely class for the query point, as it is the class that the query point is most aligned with in terms of spatial relationships and class assignments across different methods.
