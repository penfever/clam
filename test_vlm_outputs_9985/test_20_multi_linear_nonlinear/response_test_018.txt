Class: Class_4 | Reasoning: The red star is consistently closest to the cluster of points labeled as "Class_4" across all three visualization methods (PCA, T-SNE, ISOMAP). This suggests that the query point is most likely to belong to "Class_4" based on the spatial relationships and patterns observed in the data across these methods.
