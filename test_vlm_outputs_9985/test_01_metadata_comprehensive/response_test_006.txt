Class: Class_5 | Reasoning: The red star is consistently closest to the class labeled as Class_5 across all three visualization methods (PCA, t-SNE, ISOMAP). This suggests that Class_5 is the most likely class for the query point, as it is consistently the class that the red star is nearest to in all three visualizations.
