Class: Class_5 | Reasoning: The red star (query point) is consistently closest to the class labeled as Class_5 across all three visualization methods (PCA, t-SNE, ISOMAP). This consistency suggests that Class_5 is the most likely class for the query point. The spatial relationships and patterns observed in all three methods indicate that Class_5 is the class that the query point is most aligned with, making it the most probable classification.
