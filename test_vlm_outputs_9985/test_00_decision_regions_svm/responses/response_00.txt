Class: Class_3 | Reasoning: The red star is consistently closest to the class_3 cluster across both PCA and DECISION-SVC visualizations. In PCA, the red star is positioned near the class_3 cluster in both PCA components. In DECISION-SVC, the red star is also near the class_3 decision boundary. This consistency across multiple methods suggests that class_3 is the most likely classification for the query point.
