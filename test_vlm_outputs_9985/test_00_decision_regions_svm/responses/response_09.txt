Class: Class_3 | Reasoning: The red star is consistently closest to the class_3 cluster across both PCA and DECISION-SVC visualizations. In PCA, the red star is positioned near the center of the class_3 cluster, indicating it is more aligned with the class_3 distribution. In DECISION-SVC, the red star is also near the center of the class_3 cluster, suggesting it is classified as class_3. The spatial relationships and consistent clustering across both methods support this classification.
