Class: Class_3 | Reasoning: The red star is consistently closest to the class_3 cluster across both PCA and DECISION-SVC visualizations. In PCA, the red star is near the center of the class_3 cluster, and in DECISION-SVC, it is positioned within the decision boundary for class_3. This consistency across multiple methods suggests that class_3 is the most likely classification for the query point.
