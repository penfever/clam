Class: Class_3 | Reasoning: The red star is consistently closest to the class_3 cluster across both PCA and DECISION-SVC visualizations. In PCA, the red star is near the center of the class_3 cluster, while in DECISION-SVC, it is near the decision boundary that separates class_3 from other classes. This suggests that class_3 is the most likely class for the query point.
