Looking at these 2 different visualizations (PCA, T-SNE) of the same tabular classification data:

Each visualization shows:
1. Colored points representing training data, where each color corresponds to a different class
2. Gray square points representing test data  
3. One red star point which is the query point I want you to classify

The multiple visualizations provide different perspectives on the same underlying data structure:
- **PCA**: Shows linear relationships and directions of maximum variance
- **T-SNE**: t-SNE visualization of tabular data

Dataset Context: Tabular data with 2 classes and highlighted test point

Based on the position of the red star (query point) across ALL 2 visualization methods (PCA, T-SNE), which class should this query point belong to?

Consider:
- The spatial relationships across all 2 visualization methods
- Which colored class clusters the red star is consistently closest to across multiple methods
- Patterns that appear in multiple visualizations (these are more reliable than method-specific patterns)
- How different visualization methods agree or disagree about the query point's classification

Please respond with just the class label (e.g., "Bad credit risk (not creditworthy)", "Good credit risk (creditworthy)", etc.) followed by a brief explanation of your reasoning based on the multi-visualization analysis across 2 methods (PCA, T-SNE).

Format your response as: "Class: [class_label] | Reasoning: [brief explanation]"
