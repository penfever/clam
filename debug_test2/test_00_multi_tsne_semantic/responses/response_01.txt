Class: 1 | Reasoning: The red star is consistently closest to the class 1 cluster across both PCA and t-SNE visualizations. In PCA, the red star is near the class 1 points, and in t-SNE, it is also near the class 1 points. This suggests that the red star is more likely to belong to class 1 based on the spatial relationships observed in both methods.
