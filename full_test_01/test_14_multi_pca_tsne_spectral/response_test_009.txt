Class: Class_1 | Reasoning: The red star is consistently closest to the cluster of points representing "Class_1" across all three visualization methods (PCA, t-SNE, SPECTRAL). This suggests that the query point is most likely to belong to "Class_1" based on the spatial relationships and class clustering observed in all three methods.
