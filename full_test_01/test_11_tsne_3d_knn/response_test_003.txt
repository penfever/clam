Class: Class_0 | Reasoning: The query point is located in the region of the t-SNE visualization that is predominantly occupied by Class_0. The pie chart shows that all 5 nearest neighbors are from Class_0, with an average distance of 11.0, indicating high similarity. The spatial clustering patterns across all four views also support this classification, as the query point is closer to the cluster of Class_0 points.
