Looking at thisenhanced 3D t-SNE visualization of tabular data, you can see:

1. Colored points representing training data, where each color corresponds to a different class
2. Gray square points representing test data  
3. One red star point which is the query point I want you to classify
4. Four different views of the same 3D space: Isometric, Front (XZ), Side (YZ), and Top (XY)
5. A pie chart showing the distribution of the 5 nearest neighbors by class
6. The pie chart includes class counts, percentages, and average distances to neighbors

Class Legend:
- Class 0: Blue RGB(30, 119, 181)
- Class 1: Orange RGB(255, 127, 12)
- Class 2: Green RGB(43, 160, 43)
- Test points: Light Gray RGB(211, 211, 211)

This visualization shows 4 different viewing angles of the same 3D t-SNE space:
- Isometric View: Elevation=20°, Azimuth=45°
- Front View (XZ): Elevation=0°, Azimuth=0°
- Side View (YZ): Elevation=0°, Azimuth=90°
- Top View (XY): Elevation=90°, Azimuth=0°

K-NN Analysis (k=5):
• Class 0: 1 neighbors (20%), AvgDist: 19.1
• Class 1: 3 neighbors (60%), AvgDist: 11.7
• Class 2: 1 neighbors (20%), AvgDist: 11.2

Dataset Context: Tabular data embedded using appropriate features
IMPORTANT: The pie chart shows the class distribution of the 5 nearest neighbors found in the original high-dimensional embedding space, NOT just based on the 3D visualization space. Smaller average distances indicate higher similarity.

Based on BOTH the spatial position in the t-SNE visualization AND the explicit nearest neighbor connections, which class should this query point belong to? The available classes are: "Class_0", "Class_1", "Class_2"

Consider:
- The spatial clustering patterns across all four 3D views
- Which classes the nearest neighbors (connected by red lines) belong to
- The relative importance of close neighbors (thicker lines)

Please respond with just the class label (e.g., "Class_0", "Class_1", "Class_2") followed by a brief explanation of your reasoning based on the spatial clustering AND the pie chart neighbor analysis.

Format your response as: "Class: [class_label] | Reasoning: [brief explanation]"
