Class: Class_0 | Reasoning: The query point is surrounded by neighbors from Class_0 in the t-SNE visualization, and the pie chart shows that all 5 nearest neighbors are from Class_0, with an average distance of 15.9. This indicates that the query point is more similar to the neighbors from Class_0, suggesting it belongs to Class_0.
