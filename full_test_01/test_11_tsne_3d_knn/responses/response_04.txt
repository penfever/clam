Class: Class_1 | Reasoning: The query point is closer to the orange-colored points (Class_1) in the t-SNE visualization, which are also the nearest neighbors (2 neighbors with an average distance of 6.1). The pie chart shows that Class_1 has the highest percentage (40%) of the nearest neighbors, indicating that it is the most similar class to the query point.
