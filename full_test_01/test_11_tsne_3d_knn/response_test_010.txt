Class: Class_2 | Reasoning: The query point is closer to the green class (Class_2) in the t-SNE visualization, and the pie chart shows that Class_2 has the highest number of nearest neighbors (2 out of 5). Additionally, the spatial clustering patterns across all four views suggest that Class_2 is more concentrated around the query point, indicating a higher likelihood of the query point belonging to Class_2.
