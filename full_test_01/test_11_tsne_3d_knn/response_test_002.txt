Class: Class_1 | Reasoning: The query point is closer to the majority class (Class_1) in the t-SNE visualization, as indicated by the thicker red lines connecting the query point to the nearest neighbors. Additionally, the pie chart shows that Class_1 has the highest number of nearest neighbors (3 out of 5), with an average distance of 11.7, which is the lowest among the classes. This suggests that the query point is most likely to belong to Class_1.
