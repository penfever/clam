Looking at these 3 different visualizations (PCA, T-SNE, UMAP) of the same tabular classification data:

Each visualization shows:
1. Colored points representing training data, where each color corresponds to a different class
2. Gray square points representing test data  
3. One red star point which is the query point I want you to classify

The multiple visualizations provide different perspectives on the same underlying data structure:
- **PCA**: Shows linear relationships and directions of maximum variance
- **T-SNE**: t-SNE visualization of tabular data
- **UMAP**: Preserves both local and global structure with clearer cluster separation

Dataset Context: Tabular data with 3 classes and 0 highlighted test point(s)

Based on the position of the red star (query point) across ALL 3 visualization methods (PCA, T-SNE, UMAP), which class should this query point belong to? The available classes are: "Class_0", "Class_1", "Class_2"

Consider:
- The spatial relationships across all 3 visualization methods
- Which colored class clusters the red star is consistently closest to across multiple methods
- Patterns that appear in multiple visualizations (these are more reliable than method-specific patterns)
- How different visualization methods agree or disagree about the query point's classification
- Whether linear methods (PCA) and nonlinear methods show consistent or different cluster assignments

Please respond with just the class label (e.g., "Class_0", "Class_1", etc.) followed by a brief explanation of your reasoning based on the multi-visualization analysis across 3 methods (PCA, T-SNE, UMAP).
