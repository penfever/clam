Class: Class_2 | Reasoning: The red star is consistently closest to the green-colored class clusters across all three visualization methods (PCA, t-SNE, ISOMAP). This suggests that the query point is most likely associated with Class_2, as it is the class that is most frequently represented in the data and is consistently grouped with the red star in all three visualizations.
