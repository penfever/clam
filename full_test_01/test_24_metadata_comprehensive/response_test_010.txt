Class: Class_2 | Reasoning: The red star is consistently closest to the green-colored class across all three visualization methods (PCA, t-SNE, ISOMAP). This suggests that the query point is most likely associated with Class_2, as it is the class that the red star is most frequently associated with across different visualizations.
