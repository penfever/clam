Class: Class_1 | Reasoning: The query point is closer to the cluster of Class_1 neighbors (3 neighbors) than to the other classes. The pie chart shows that Class_1 has the highest percentage (60%) of the nearest neighbors, and the average distance to these neighbors is the lowest (11.7). This indicates that the query point is more similar to the Class_1 neighbors than to the other classes.
