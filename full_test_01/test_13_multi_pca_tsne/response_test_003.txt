Class: Class_1 | Reasoning: The red star is consistently closest to the class_1 cluster across both PCA and t-SNE visualizations. In PCA, the red star is near the class_1 cluster in the direction of the highest variance. In t-SNE, the red star is near the class_1 cluster in the lower-dimensional space, indicating that class_1 is the most similar class to the query point.
