Class: Class_1 | Reasoning: The red star is consistently closest to the class_1 cluster across both PCA and t-SNE visualizations. In PCA, the red star is near the class_1 cluster in the first principal component direction. In t-SNE, the red star is near the class_1 cluster in the first t-SNE component. This consistency across different visualization methods suggests that the red star is most likely from class_1.
