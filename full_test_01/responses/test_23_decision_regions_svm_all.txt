Class: Class_2 | Reasoning: The red star is consistently closest to the green class clusters across both PCA and DECISION-VISUALIZATIONCONFIG visualizations. This suggests that the red star is more likely to belong to Class_2 based on the spatial relationships and patterns observed in both methods.
