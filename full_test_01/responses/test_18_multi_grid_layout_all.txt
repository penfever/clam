Class: Class_1 | Reasoning: The red star is consistently closest to the cluster of points representing Class_1 across both PCA and T-SNE visualizations. This suggests that the query point is most likely to belong to Class_1 based on the spatial relationships and patterns observed in both methods.

=== RESPONSE ===

Class: Class_1 | Reasoning: The red star is consistently closest to the green-colored class clusters in both PCA and T-SNE visualizations. This suggests that the query point is most similar to the data points in Class_1 across different representations of the data.
