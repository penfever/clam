Class: Class_1 | Reasoning: The red star is consistently closest to the cluster of points representing "Class_1" across all four visualization methods. This is evident in the PCA, T-SNE, SPECTRAL, and ISOMAP plots, where the red star is positioned near the center of the "Class_1" cluster. The other classes ("Class_0" and "Class_2") are either more distant or do not show a clear cluster around the red star in any of the methods.
