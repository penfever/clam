Class: Class_1 | Reasoning: The red star (query point) is consistently closest to the cluster of points representing "Class_1" across all four visualization methods. This consistency across different methods suggests that the query point is most likely to belong to "Class_1". The spatial relationships and patterns observed in the visualizations indicate that "Class_1" is the most similar class to the query point in terms of the underlying data structure.
