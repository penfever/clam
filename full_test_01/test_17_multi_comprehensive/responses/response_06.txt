Class: Class_1 | Reasoning: The red star (query point) is consistently closest to the cluster of points representing "Class_1" across all four visualization methods (PCA, T-SNE, SPECTRAL, ISOMAP). This consistency suggests that the query point is most likely to belong to "Class_1" based on the spatial relationships and patterns observed in the data across these different visualization techniques.
