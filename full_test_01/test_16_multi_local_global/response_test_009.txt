Class: Class_1 | Reasoning: The red star is consistently closest to the "Class_1" cluster across all three visualization methods (T-SNE, ISOMAP, MDS). This suggests that the query point is most likely to belong to "Class_1" based on the spatial relationships and patterns observed in the data across these different visualization techniques.
