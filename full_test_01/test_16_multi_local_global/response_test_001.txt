Class: Class_1 | Reasoning: The red star is consistently closest to the "Class_1" cluster across all three visualization methods (T-SNE, ISOMAP, MDS). This suggests that the query point is most similar to the data points in "Class_1" in terms of both local and global structure, as evidenced by the consistent proximity in all three plots.
