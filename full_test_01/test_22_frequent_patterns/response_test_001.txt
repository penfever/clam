Class: Class_1 | Reasoning: The red star is consistently closest to the class_1 cluster across both PCA and FREQUENT-PATTERNS visualizations. In the PCA plot, the red star is near the class_1 cluster in the lower right quadrant. In the FREQUENT-PATTERNS plot, the red star is near the class_1 cluster in the middle right section. Both visualizations show that class_1 is the most frequently occurring class around the query point, indicating that it is the most likely class for the query point.
