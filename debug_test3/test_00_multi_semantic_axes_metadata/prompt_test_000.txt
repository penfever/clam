Looking at these 2 different visualizations (PCA, T-SNE) of the same tabular classification data:

Each visualization shows:
1. Colored points representing training data, where each color corresponds to a different class
2. Gray square points representing test data  
3. One red star point which is the query point I want you to classify

The multiple visualizations provide different perspectives on the same underlying data structure:
- **PCA**: Shows linear relationships and directions of maximum variance
- **T-SNE**: t-SNE visualization of tabular data

Dataset Context: Tabular data with 2 classes and highlighted test point 
Dataset: German Credit dataset for credit risk assessment. This dataset classifies people described by a set of attributes as good or bad credit risks. Based on demographic and financial profiles of loan applicants, the dataset enables banks to predict creditworthiness and make informed lending decisions. | Key features: checking_status; duration; credit_history; purpose; credit_amount: Credit amount requested by the applicant in Deutsche Mark. | Classes: "1": Good credit risk - likely to repay loan; "2": Bad credit risk - unlikely to repay loan

Based on the position of the red star (query point) across ALL 2 visualization methods (PCA, T-SNE), which class should this query point belong to?

Consider:
- The spatial relationships across all 2 visualization methods
- Which colored class clusters the red star is consistently closest to across multiple methods
- Patterns that appear in multiple visualizations (these are more reliable than method-specific patterns)
- How different visualization methods agree or disagree about the query point's classification

Please respond with just the class label (e.g., "0", "1", etc.) followed by a brief explanation of your reasoning based on the multi-visualization analysis across 2 methods (PCA, T-SNE).

Format your response as: "Class: [class_label] | Reasoning: [brief explanation]"
