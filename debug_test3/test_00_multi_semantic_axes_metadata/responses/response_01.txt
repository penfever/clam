Class: 1 | Reasoning: The red star is consistently closest to the class 1 cluster across both PCA and t-SNE visualizations. In PCA, the red star is near the class 1 points, and in t-SNE, it is near the class 1 points as well. This indicates that the red star is more likely to belong to class 1 based on the spatial relationships and consistent clustering across both methods.
