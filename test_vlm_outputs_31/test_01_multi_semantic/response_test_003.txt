Class: 1 | Reasoning: The red star is consistently closest to the class 1 cluster across both PCA and T-SNE visualizations. In PCA, the red star is positioned near the class 1 points, indicating a higher density of class 1 data points around it. In T-SNE, the red star is also near the class 1 cluster, suggesting that the query point is more similar to class 1 data in the lower-dimensional space. Both methods indicate that the query point is more likely to belong to class 1.
