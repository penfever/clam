Class: 1 | Reasoning: The red star (query point) is consistently closest to the orange-colored class clusters across both PCA and t-SNE visualizations. This suggests that the query point is more aligned with the characteristics of the data from class 1, as it is more centrally located within the cluster of class 1 points in both PCA and t-SNE space.
