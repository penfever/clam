Class: 1 | Reasoning: The red star (query point) is consistently closest to the class 1 cluster across both PCA and t-SNE visualizations. In PCA, the red star is positioned near the class 1 points, indicating a higher similarity to class 1. In t-SNE, the red star is also near the class 1 points, suggesting that the query point is more aligned with the characteristics of class 1 data. The spatial proximity in both methods supports the classification of the query point as class 1.
