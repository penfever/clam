Class: 1 | Reasoning: The red star (query point) is consistently closest to the orange-colored class clusters across both PCA and t-SNE visualizations. This suggests that the query point is more aligned with the data points of the "Bad credit risk" class, which is indicated by the orange color. The spatial relationships and patterns observed in both PCA and t-SNE visualizations reinforce this classification.
