Class: Class_0 | Reasoning: The query point is closer to the cluster of Class_0 points in all four 3D views. Additionally, the pie chart shows that the nearest neighbors of the query point are predominantly from Class_0, with the average distance to these neighbors being smaller than to Class_1 neighbors. This indicates that the query point is more similar to the Class_0 points.
