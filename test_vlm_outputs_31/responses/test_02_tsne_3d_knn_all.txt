Class: Class_1 | Reasoning: The query point is closer to the orange-colored points (Class_1) in the t-SNE visualization, indicating higher similarity. Additionally, the pie chart shows that the nearest neighbors of the query point are predominantly from Class_1, with the smallest average distance to neighbors, suggesting that Class_1 is the most likely class for the query point.

Class: Class_1 | Reasoning: The query point is closer to the orange-colored points (Class_1) in all four views of the t-SNE visualization. Additionally, the pie chart shows that the nearest neighbors of the query point are predominantly from Class_1, with the average distance to these neighbors being smaller than the average distance to the nearest neighbors of Class_0. This indicates that the query point is more similar to the Class_1 data points.

Class: Class_1 | Reasoning: The query point is closer to the orange-colored points (Class_1) in all four views of the t-SNE visualization. Additionally, the pie chart shows that the nearest neighbors of the query point are predominantly from Class_1, with the average distance to these neighbors being smaller than to the blue-colored points (Class_0). This indicates that the query point is more similar to Class_1 based on both spatial clustering and nearest neighbor analysis.
