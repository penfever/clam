Class: Class_1 | Reasoning: The red star is consistently closest to the orange-colored class clusters across both PCA and t-SNE visualizations. This suggests that the query point is more aligned with the characteristics of the Class_1 data, as it is more centrally located within the cluster of Class_1 points in both PCA and t-SNE space.
