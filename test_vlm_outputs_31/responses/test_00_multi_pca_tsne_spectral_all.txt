Class: Class_1 | Reasoning: The red star is consistently closest to the class_1 colored points across all three visualization methods (PCA, T-SNE, SPECTRAL). This suggests that the query point is more aligned with the class_1 distribution, indicating that it should be classified as Class_1.

=== RESPONSE ===

Class: Class_1 | Reasoning: The red star is consistently closest to the orange-colored class clusters across all three visualization methods (PCA, T-SNE, SPECTRAL). This suggests that the query point is more aligned with the characteristics of Class_1, as it is consistently grouped with the orange-colored points in all three visualizations.

=== RESPONSE ===

Class: Class_1 | Reasoning: The red star is consistently closest to the orange-colored class clusters across all three visualization methods (PCA, T-SNE, SPECTRAL). This suggests that the query point is more aligned with the characteristics of Class_1, as it is more centrally located within the cluster of Class_1 points in all three visualizations.
