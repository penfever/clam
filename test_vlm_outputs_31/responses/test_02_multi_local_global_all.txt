Class: Class_1 | Reasoning: The red star (query point) is consistently closest to the class_1 colored points across all three visualization methods (T-SNE, ISOMAP, MDS). This indicates that the query point is more likely to belong to class_1 based on the spatial relationships and patterns observed in all three visualizations.

Class: Class_1 | Reasoning: The red star is consistently closest to the class_1 colored points across all three visualization methods (T-SNE, ISOMAP, MDS). This suggests that the query point is more likely to belong to class_1 based on the spatial relationships observed in these methods.

=== RESPONSE ===

Class: Class_1 | Reasoning: The red star is consistently closest to the class_1 colored points across all three visualization methods (T-SNE, ISOMAP, MDS). This suggests that the query point is more similar to the class_1 data points in the underlying data structure, indicating that it should be classified as Class_1.
