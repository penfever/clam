Class: Class_0 | Reasoning: The query point is closer to the blue-colored points (Class_0) in all four 3D views, indicating higher similarity to Class_0. Additionally, the pie chart shows that the nearest neighbors to the query point are predominantly from Class_0, with the smallest average distance to neighbors, suggesting that Class_0 is the most likely class for the query point.

=== RESPONSE ===

Class: Class_0 | Reasoning: The query point is closer to the cluster of Class_0 points in all four views of the t-SNE visualization. Additionally, the pie chart shows that the nearest neighbors to the query point are predominantly from Class_0, with the smallest average distance to neighbors, indicating higher similarity to Class_0.

=== RESPONSE ===

Class: Class_1 | Reasoning: The query point is closer to the orange-colored points (Class_1) in all four 3D views, indicating higher similarity. Additionally, the pie chart shows that the nearest neighbors of the query point are predominantly from Class_1, with the average distance to these neighbors being smaller than to the blue-colored points (Class_0). This suggests that the query point is more likely to belong to Class_1.
