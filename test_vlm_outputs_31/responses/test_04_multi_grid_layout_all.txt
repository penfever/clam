=== RESPONSE ===

Class: Class_1 | Reasoning: The red star is consistently closest to the class_1 cluster across both PCA and t-SNE visualizations. In PCA, the red star is near the class_1 cluster in the direction of maximum variance. In t-SNE, the red star is near the class_1 cluster, indicating that it is more similar to the class_1 data points. This consistency across both methods suggests that the red star should be classified as class_1.
