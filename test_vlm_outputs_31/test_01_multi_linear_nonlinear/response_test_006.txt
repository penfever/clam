Class: Class_1 | Reasoning: The red star (query point) is consistently closest to the orange-colored class across all three visualization methods (PCA, T-SNE, ISOMAP). This suggests that the query point is more likely to belong to Class_1 based on the spatial relationships and patterns observed in the data across these different methods.
