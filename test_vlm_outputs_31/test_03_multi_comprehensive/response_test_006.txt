Class: Class_0 | Reasoning: The red star is consistently closest to the blue-colored class clusters across all four visualization methods. This indicates that the query point is more similar to the data points in Class_0 than in Class_1. The spatial relationships and patterns observed in the PCA, T-SNE, SPECTRAL, and ISOMAP plots support this conclusion, as the red star appears to be more centrally located within the blue-colored class clusters.
