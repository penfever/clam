Class: Class_1 | Reasoning: The red star is consistently closest to the class_1 cluster across all four visualization methods. In PCA, T-SNE, and SPECTRAL, the red star is positioned near the class_1 cluster. In ISOMAP, the red star is also near the class_1 cluster, indicating a strong alignment with the class_1 data points. This consistency across multiple methods suggests that the red star is most likely from Class_1.
