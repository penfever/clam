Class: Class_1 | Reasoning: The red star is consistently closest to the cluster of points representing Class_1 across all four visualization methods. This is evident in the PCA, T-SNE, SPECTRAL, and ISOMAP plots, where the red star is more centrally located within the Class_1 cluster compared to the other classes. The spatial relationships and patterns across these methods suggest that the query point is more aligned with the characteristics of Class_1, making it the most likely class for this point.
