Class: Class_1 | Reasoning: The query point is closer to the orange-colored points (Class_1) in the t-SNE visualization, indicating higher similarity. Additionally, the pie chart shows that the nearest neighbors of the query point are predominantly from Class_1, with the smallest average distance to neighbors, suggesting that Class_1 is the most likely class for the query point.
