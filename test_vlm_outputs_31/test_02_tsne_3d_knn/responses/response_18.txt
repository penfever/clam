Class: Class_1 | Reasoning: The query point is closer to the orange-colored points (Class_1) in all four views of the t-SNE visualization. Additionally, the pie chart shows that the nearest neighbors of the query point are predominantly from Class_1, with the average distance to these neighbors being smaller than to the blue-colored points (Class_0). This indicates that the query point is more similar to the Class_1 points in the original high-dimensional embedding space.
