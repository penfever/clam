Class: Class_1 | Reasoning: The query point is closer to the orange-colored points (Class_1) in all four views of the t-SNE visualization. Additionally, the pie chart shows that the nearest neighbors of the query point are predominantly from Class_1, with a smaller number of neighbors from Class_0. The relative closeness of the query point to the orange-colored points and the higher number of neighbors from Class_1 in the pie chart suggest that the query point is more likely to belong to Class_1.
