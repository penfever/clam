Class: Class_1 | Reasoning: The query point is closer to the orange-colored points (Class_1) in the t-SNE visualization, indicating higher similarity. Additionally, the pie chart shows that the nearest neighbors of the query point are predominantly from Class_1, with the average distance to these neighbors being smaller than to the other classes. This suggests that the query point is more likely to belong to Class_1.
