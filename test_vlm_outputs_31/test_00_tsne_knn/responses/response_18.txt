Class: Class_0 | Reasoning: The query point is closer to the cluster of Class_0 points in the t-SNE visualization. Additionally, the pie chart shows that the nearest neighbors of the query point are predominantly from Class_0, with a smaller number of neighbors from Class_1. This suggests that the query point is more similar to the Class_0 data points.
