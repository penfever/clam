Class: Class_1 | Reasoning: The query point is closer to the orange-colored points (Class_1) in the t-SNE visualization, indicating higher similarity. Additionally, the pie chart shows that the nearest neighbors to the query point are predominantly from Class_1, with a smaller number of neighbors from Class_0. This suggests that the query point is more likely to belong to Class_1.
