Looking at thisenhanced t-SNE visualization of tabular data, you can see:

1. Colored points representing training data, where each color corresponds to a different class
2. Gray square points representing test data  
3. One red star point which is the query point I want you to classify
4. A pie chart showing the distribution of the 5 nearest neighbors by class
5. The pie chart includes class counts, percentages, and average distances to neighbors

Dataset Context: Test dataset with 2 classes
IMPORTANT: The pie chart shows the class distribution of the 5 nearest neighbors found in the original high-dimensional embedding space, NOT just based on the 2D visualization space. Smaller average distances indicate higher similarity.

Based on BOTH the spatial position in the t-SNE visualization AND the explicit nearest neighbor connections, which class should this query point belong to?

Consider:
- The spatial clustering patterns in the t-SNE visualization
- Which classes the nearest neighbors (connected by red lines) belong to
- The relative importance of close neighbors (thicker lines)

Please respond with just the class label (e.g., "Class_0", "Class_1", "Class_2") followed by a brief explanation of your reasoning based on the spatial clustering AND the pie chart neighbor analysis.

Format your response as: "Class: [class_label] | Reasoning: [brief explanation]"
