Looking at these 3 different visualizations (T-SNE, ISOMAP, MDS) of the same tabular classification data:

Each visualization shows:
1. Colored points representing training data, where each color corresponds to a different class
2. Gray square points representing test data  
3. One red star point which is the query point I want you to classify

The multiple visualizations provide different perspectives on the same underlying data structure:
- **T-SNE**: t-SNE visualization of tabular data
- **ISOMAP**: Preserves geodesic distances along the data manifold
- **MDS**: Preserves pairwise distances between data points

Dataset Context: Tabular data with 2 classes and highlighted test point

Based on the position of the red star (query point) across ALL 3 visualization methods (T-SNE, ISOMAP, MDS), which class should this query point belong to?

Consider:
- The spatial relationships across all 3 visualization methods
- Which colored class clusters the red star is consistently closest to across multiple methods
- Patterns that appear in multiple visualizations (these are more reliable than method-specific patterns)
- How different visualization methods agree or disagree about the query point's classification

Please respond with just the class label (e.g., "Class_0", "Class_1", "Class_2") followed by a brief explanation of your reasoning based on the multi-visualization analysis across 3 methods (T-SNE, ISOMAP, MDS).

Format your response as: "Class: [class_label] | Reasoning: [brief explanation]"
