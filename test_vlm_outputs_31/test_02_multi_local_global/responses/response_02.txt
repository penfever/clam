Class: Class_1 | Reasoning: The red star (query point) is consistently closest to the class_1 colored points across all three visualization methods (T-SNE, ISOMAP, MDS). This indicates that the query point is more likely to belong to class_1 based on the spatial relationships and patterns observed in all three visualizations.
