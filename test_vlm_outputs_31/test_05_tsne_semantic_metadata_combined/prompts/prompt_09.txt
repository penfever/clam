Looking at this t-SNE visualization of tabular data, you can see:

1. Colored points representing training data, where each color corresponds to a different class
2. Gray square points representing test data  
3. One red star point which is the query point I want you to classify

Dataset Context: Test dataset with 2 classes

Based on the position of the red star (query point) relative to the colored training points, which class should this query point belong to? The available classes are: "Good credit risk (creditworthy)", "Bad credit risk (not creditworthy)"

Consider:
- The spatial relationships in the t-SNE visualization
- Which colored class clusters the red star is closest to or embedded within

Please respond with just the class label (e.g., "Good credit risk (creditworthy)", "Bad credit risk (not creditworthy)", etc.) followed by a brief explanation of your reasoning based on the spatial clustering patterns you observe.

Format your response as: "Class: [class_label] | Reasoning: [brief explanation]"
