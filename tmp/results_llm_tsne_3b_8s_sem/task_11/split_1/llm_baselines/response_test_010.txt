Class: R | Reasoning: The query point is closer to the "R" class neighbors (green) in the t-SNE visualization, and the pie chart shows that the "R" class has a higher percentage of neighbors (50%) compared to the "B" class (50%). The average distance to the "R" class neighbors (10.02) is slightly higher than to the "B" class neighbors (8.44), but the spatial proximity and higher percentage of neighbors suggest that the query point is more likely to belong to the "R" class.
