Class: B | Reasoning: The query point is closer to the B class neighbors (orange) than to the L class neighbors (blue) in the t-SNE visualization. Additionally, the pie chart shows that the B class neighbors have a higher percentage (50%) and a slightly lower average distance (12.80) compared to the L class neighbors (50% and 10.33). This suggests that the query point is more similar to the B class neighbors, indicating that it should be classified as B.
