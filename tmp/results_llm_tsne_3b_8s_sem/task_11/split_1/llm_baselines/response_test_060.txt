Class: R | Reasoning: The query point is closer to the green points (R) in the t-SNE visualization, indicating higher similarity to the R class. Additionally, the pie chart shows that the query point has two neighbors in the R class, which is the highest count among the three classes. This suggests that the query point is more likely to belong to the R class based on both spatial clustering and the explicit nearest neighbor analysis.
