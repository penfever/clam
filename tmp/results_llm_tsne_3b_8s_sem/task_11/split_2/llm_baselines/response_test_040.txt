Class: B | Reasoning: The query point is closer to the B class neighbors (orange) than to the R class neighbors (green). The pie chart shows that the B class has a 50% probability of being the nearest neighbor, which is higher than the 50% probability for the R class. Additionally, the B class neighbors are closer to the query point (AvgDist: 7.65) than the R class neighbors (AvgDist: 7.11).
