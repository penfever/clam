Class: B | Reasoning: The query point is closer to the B class neighbors (orange) than to the R class neighbors (green). The pie chart shows that the B class has a 50% probability of being the nearest neighbor, which is higher than the 50% probability for the R class. Additionally, the average distance to the B class neighbors (6.89) is slightly lower than the average distance to the R class neighbors (7.81), indicating higher similarity to the B class.
