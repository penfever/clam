Looking at thisenhanced t-SNE visualization of tabular data, you can see:

1. Colored points representing training data, where each color corresponds to a different class
2. Gray square points representing test data  
3. One red star point which is the query point I want you to classify
4. A pie chart showing the distribution of the 2 nearest neighbors by class
5. The pie chart includes class counts, percentages, and average distances to neighbors

Class Legend:
- L: Blue RGB(30, 119, 181)
- B: Orange RGB(255, 127, 12)
- R: Green RGB(43, 160, 43)

K-NN Analysis (k=2):
â€¢ R: 2 neighbors (100%), AvgDist: 11.18

Dataset Context: Tabular data embedded using appropriate features 
Dataset: Balance Scale Weight & Distance Database generated to model psychological experimental results. Each example represents a balance scale scenario with weights and distances on both sides. The task is to predict whether the scale tips left, tips right, or remains balanced based on the physics principle of torque. | Key features: Left weight: Weight on the left side of the balance scale (1-5); Left distance: Distance of left weight from the fulcrum (1-5); Right weight: Weight on the right side of the balance scale (1-5); Right distance: Distance of right weight from the fulcrum (1-5) | Classes: "L": Balance scale tips to the left; "B": Balance scale remains balanced; "R": Balance scale tips to the right
IMPORTANT: The pie chart shows the class distribution of the 2 nearest neighbors found in the original high-dimensional embedding space, NOT just based on the 2D visualization space. Smaller average distances indicate higher similarity.

Based on BOTH the spatial position in the t-SNE visualization AND the explicit nearest neighbor connections, which class should this query point belong to?

Consider:
- The spatial clustering patterns in the t-SNE visualization
- Which classes the nearest neighbors (connected by red lines) belong to
- The relative importance of close neighbors (thicker lines)

Please respond with just the class label (e.g., "L", "B", etc.) followed by a brief explanation of your reasoning based on the spatial clustering AND the pie chart neighbor analysis.

Format your response as: "Class: [class_label] | Reasoning: [brief explanation]"
