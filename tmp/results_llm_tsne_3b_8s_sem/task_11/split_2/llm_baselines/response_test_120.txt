Class: L | Reasoning: The query point is closer to the blue points (L) than to the orange (B) or green (R) points. The pie chart shows that the nearest neighbors to the query point are both from class L, with an average distance of 12.17, which is higher than the average distance of the nearest neighbors from class B (9.80). This suggests that the query point is more similar to the L class than to the B class.
