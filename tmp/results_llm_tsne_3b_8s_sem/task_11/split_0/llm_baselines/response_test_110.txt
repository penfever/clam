Class: B | Reasoning: The query point is closer to the B class neighbors (orange) than to the R class neighbors (green). The pie chart shows that the B class neighbors are closer to the query point than the R class neighbors, indicating higher similarity. Additionally, the spatial clustering in the t-SNE visualization suggests that the B class is more concentrated around the query point, further supporting the classification.
