Class: B | Reasoning: The query point is closer to the B class neighbors (orange) than to the R class neighbors (green). The pie chart shows that the B class has a 50% probability of being the nearest neighbor, which is higher than the 50% probability for the R class. Additionally, the B class neighbors have a slightly lower average distance (13.28) compared to the R class neighbors (12.27), indicating higher similarity.
