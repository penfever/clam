Class: B | Reasoning: The query point is closer to the B class neighbors (orange) than to the R class neighbors (green). The pie chart shows that the B class has a 50% probability of being the nearest neighbor, with an average distance of 8.94, which is slightly higher than the R class's 8.50. This suggests that the query point is more likely to belong to the B class based on both the spatial proximity and the neighbor analysis.
