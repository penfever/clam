Class: L | Reasoning: The query point is closer to the blue class (L) than to the orange class (B) in the t-SNE visualization. Additionally, the nearest neighbors of the query point are both from the L class, as indicated by the pie chart, which shows that both neighbors are L and have a smaller average distance compared to the R class.
