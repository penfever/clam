Class: L | Reasoning: The query point is closer to the "L" class neighbors (12.09 average distance) compared to the "B" class neighbors (11.95 average distance). Additionally, the spatial clustering in the t-SNE visualization shows that the "L" class is more concentrated in the lower right quadrant, which aligns with the query point's position.
