Class: 3 | Reasoning: The query point is located near the red star in the t-SNE visualization, which is connected to the class 3 (red) by a thick red line. The pie chart shows that the nearest neighbors to the query point are from class 3 (red), with an average distance of 11.40, which is the smallest among the four neighbors. This suggests that the query point is most likely from class 3 based on both the spatial proximity and the nearest neighbor analysis.
