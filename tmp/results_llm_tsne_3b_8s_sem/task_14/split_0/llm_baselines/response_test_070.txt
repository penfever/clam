Class: 6 | Reasoning: The query point is surrounded by points from class 6 (pink) in the t-SNE visualization. The pie chart shows that the nearest neighbors (4 neighbors) are from class 6, with an average distance of 4.80, which is the smallest among the four neighbors. This indicates that the query point is most similar to class 6 based on both spatial clustering and the explicit nearest neighbor analysis.
