Class: 6 | Reasoning: The query point is surrounded by neighbors from class 6, and the pie chart shows that all 4 nearest neighbors are from class 6, with no other classes represented. The spatial clustering in the t-SNE visualization also supports this, as the query point is close to the cluster of points representing class 6.
