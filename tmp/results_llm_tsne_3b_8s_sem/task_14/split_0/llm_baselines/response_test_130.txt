Class: 4 | Reasoning: The query point is surrounded by neighbors from class 4, and the pie chart shows that class 4 has the highest percentage of neighbors (50%). The spatial clustering pattern also indicates that class 4 is more densely populated in the t-SNE visualization, suggesting that the query point is closer to class 4 than to other classes.
