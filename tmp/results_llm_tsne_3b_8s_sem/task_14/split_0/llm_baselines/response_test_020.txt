Class: 0 | Reasoning: The query point is located near the blue-colored class points in the t-SNE visualization, which are the nearest neighbors. The pie chart shows that the nearest neighbors to the query point are both from class 0, with an average distance of 11.03, which is slightly lower than the average distance of the other class (8), which is 11.39. This suggests that the query point is more similar to the class 0 neighbors than to the class 8 neighbors.
