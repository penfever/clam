Looking at thisenhanced t-SNE visualization of tabular data, you can see:

1. Colored points representing training data, where each color corresponds to a different class
2. Gray square points representing test data  
3. One red star point which is the query point I want you to classify
4. A pie chart showing the distribution of the 4 nearest neighbors by class
5. The pie chart includes class counts, percentages, and average distances to neighbors

Class Legend:
- 0: Blue RGB(30, 119, 181)
- 1: Orange RGB(255, 127, 12)
- 2: Green RGB(43, 160, 43)
- 3: Red RGB(214, 38, 40)
- 4: Purple RGB(147, 102, 188)
- 5: Brown RGB(140, 86, 73)
- 6: Pink RGB(226, 119, 193)
- 7: Gray RGB(127, 127, 127)
- 8: Olive RGB(188, 188, 33)
- 9: Cyan RGB(22, 191, 206)

K-NN Analysis (k=4):
• 1: 2 neighbors (50%), AvgDist: 6.50
• 4: 2 neighbors (50%), AvgDist: 6.50

Dataset Context: Tabular data embedded using appropriate features 
Dataset: Multiple Features Dataset: Fourier coefficients. One of six datasets describing features of handwritten numerals (0-9) extracted from Dutch utility maps. This dataset contains Fourier coefficients of the character shapes, capturing frequency domain characteristics. | Key features: Fourier coefficient 1; Fourier coefficient 2; Fourier coefficient 3; Fourier coefficient 4; Fourier coefficient 5 | Classes: "0": Digit 0; "1": Digit 1; "2": Digit 2; "3": Digit 3; "4": Digit 4; "5": Digit 5; "6": Digit 6; "7": Digit 7; "8": Digit 8; "9": Digit 9
IMPORTANT: The pie chart shows the class distribution of the 4 nearest neighbors found in the original high-dimensional embedding space, NOT just based on the 2D visualization space. Smaller average distances indicate higher similarity.

Based on BOTH the spatial position in the t-SNE visualization AND the explicit nearest neighbor connections, which class should this query point belong to?

Consider:
- The spatial clustering patterns in the t-SNE visualization
- Which classes the nearest neighbors (connected by red lines) belong to
- The relative importance of close neighbors (thicker lines)

Please respond with just the class label (e.g., "0", "1", etc.) followed by a brief explanation of your reasoning based on the spatial clustering AND the pie chart neighbor analysis.

Format your response as: "Class: [class_label] | Reasoning: [brief explanation]"
