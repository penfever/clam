Class: 3 | Reasoning: The query point is located near the cluster of points representing class 3 in the t-SNE visualization. The pie chart shows that the nearest neighbors to the query point are all from class 3, with the smallest average distance (9.18). This indicates that the query point is most similar to class 3 based on both its spatial position and the explicit nearest neighbor analysis.
