Class: 0 | Reasoning: The query point is located near the blue-colored class points in the t-SNE visualization, which are the closest neighbors according to the pie chart analysis. The pie chart shows that the nearest neighbors to the query point are from class 6, which is represented by the blue color. This suggests that the query point is more similar to the blue-colored class points than to the other classes.
