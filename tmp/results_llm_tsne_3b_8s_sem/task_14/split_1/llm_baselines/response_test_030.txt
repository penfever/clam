Class: 6 | Reasoning: The query point is surrounded by neighbors from class 6 (pink) in the t-SNE visualization. The pie chart shows that 75% of the nearest neighbors are from class 6, with an average distance of 8.26, which is closer than the 25% from class 9 (cyan) with an average distance of 9.29. Therefore, the query point is more likely to belong to class 6.
