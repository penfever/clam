Class: 3 | Reasoning: The query point is located near the cluster of points representing class 3 in the t-SNE visualization. The pie chart shows that the nearest neighbors (connected by red lines) are all from class 3, with the average distance to neighbors being 11.94, which is the smallest among the other classes. This suggests that the query point is most likely from class 3 based on both its spatial position and the explicit nearest neighbor analysis.
