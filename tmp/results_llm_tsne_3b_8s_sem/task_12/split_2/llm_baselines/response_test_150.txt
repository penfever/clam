Class: 6 | Reasoning: The query point is surrounded by neighbors from class 6, and the pie chart shows that all 4 nearest neighbors are from class 6, with a 100% count and an average distance of 10.86. The spatial clustering in the t-SNE visualization also supports this, as class 6 appears to be more densely clustered around the query point compared to other classes.
