Class: 2 | Reasoning: The query point is located near the cluster of points representing class 2 in the t-SNE visualization. The pie chart shows that the nearest neighbors (k=4) are all from class 2, with no other classes represented. The spatial proximity and the explicit connection to class 2 in the nearest neighbor analysis support this classification.
