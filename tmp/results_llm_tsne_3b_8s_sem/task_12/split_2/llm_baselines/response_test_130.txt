Class: 6 | Reasoning: The query point is surrounded by neighbors from class 6, which has the highest percentage (75%) of nearest neighbors. The spatial clustering in the t-SNE visualization also suggests that class 6 is more densely populated around the query point, indicating a higher likelihood of the query point belonging to class 6.
