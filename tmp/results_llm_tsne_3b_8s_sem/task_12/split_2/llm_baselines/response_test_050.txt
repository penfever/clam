Class: 3 | Reasoning: The query point is located near the red star, which is connected to four neighbors. The pie chart shows that three of these neighbors belong to class 3, with the fourth neighbor being class 4. The spatial clustering in the t-SNE visualization also suggests that class 3 is the most likely class for the query point, as it is closer to the cluster of points representing class 3.
