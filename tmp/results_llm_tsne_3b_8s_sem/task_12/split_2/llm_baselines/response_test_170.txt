Class: 6 | Reasoning: The query point is surrounded by neighbors from class 6, which has the highest percentage of neighbors (75%) and the smallest average distance (9.54). The spatial clustering in the t-SNE visualization also supports this, as class 6 appears to be more densely clustered around the query point compared to other classes.
