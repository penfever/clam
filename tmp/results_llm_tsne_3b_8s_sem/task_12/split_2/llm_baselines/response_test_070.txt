Class: 3 | Reasoning: The query point is located near the red star, which is connected to four neighbors. The pie chart shows that the nearest neighbors belong to class 3, and the average distance to these neighbors is 10.43, indicating high similarity. The spatial clustering in the t-SNE visualization also supports this classification, as class 3 appears to be more concentrated in the area where the query point is located.
