Class: 7 | Reasoning: The query point is surrounded by neighbors from class 7, and the pie chart shows that all 4 nearest neighbors are from class 7. The spatial clustering in the t-SNE visualization also supports this, as class 7 appears to be more densely populated in the region around the query point.
