Class: 9 | Reasoning: The query point is surrounded by neighbors that are also classified as 9, and the pie chart shows that all 4 nearest neighbors are from class 9. The spatial clustering in the t-SNE visualization also supports this, as the query point is close to the cluster of points representing class 9.
