Class: 0 | Reasoning: The query point is located near the blue-colored class (0) in the t-SNE visualization. The pie chart shows that the nearest neighbors (4 neighbors) are all from class 0, with an average distance of 9.38. This indicates that the query point is highly similar to the class 0 neighbors, suggesting that class 0 is the most likely class for the query point.
