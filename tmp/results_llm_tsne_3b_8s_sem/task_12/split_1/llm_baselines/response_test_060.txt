Class: 4 | Reasoning: The query point is closer to the class 4 cluster in the t-SNE visualization and its nearest neighbors (connected by red lines) are also from class 4, as indicated by the pie chart. The pie chart shows that all 4 nearest neighbors belong to class 4, with a 100% count and an average distance of 6.50, suggesting that class 4 is the most likely class for the query point.
