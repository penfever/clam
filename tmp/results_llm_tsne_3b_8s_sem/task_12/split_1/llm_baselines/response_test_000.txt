Class: 3 | Reasoning: The query point is surrounded by neighbors that are also classified as class 3, and the pie chart shows that class 3 has the highest percentage of neighbors among the four nearest neighbors. Additionally, the spatial clustering in the t-SNE visualization suggests that class 3 is distinct from the other classes, which is further supported by the high percentage of neighbors in the pie chart.
