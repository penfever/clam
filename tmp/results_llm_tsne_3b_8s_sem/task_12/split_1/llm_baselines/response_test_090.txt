Class: 4 | Reasoning: The query point is surrounded by neighbors from class 4, and the pie chart shows that class 4 has the highest percentage of neighbors among the four nearest neighbors. Additionally, the spatial clustering in the t-SNE visualization suggests that class 4 is distinct from the other classes, which is further supported by the high percentage of neighbors from class 4.
