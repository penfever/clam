Class: 8 | Reasoning: The query point is surrounded by neighbors that are also classified as 8, and the pie chart shows that all 4 nearest neighbors are classified as 8. The spatial clustering in the t-SNE visualization also supports this, as the query point is close to the cluster of points labeled 8.
