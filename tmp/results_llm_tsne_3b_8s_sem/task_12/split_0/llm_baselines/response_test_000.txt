Class: 2 | Reasoning: The query point is located near the green class cluster in the t-SNE visualization. The pie chart shows that the nearest neighbors (2 neighbors each) are from the green class, with an average distance of 15.83, which is closer than the average distance of the other classes. This suggests that the query point is more similar to the green class than to the other classes.
