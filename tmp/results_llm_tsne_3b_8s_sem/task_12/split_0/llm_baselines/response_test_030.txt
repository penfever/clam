Class: 2 | Reasoning: The query point is located near the cluster of points representing class 2 in the t-SNE visualization. The pie chart shows that the nearest neighbors to the query point are all from class 2, with no other classes represented. The spatial proximity and the clear majority of neighbors from class 2 support this classification.
