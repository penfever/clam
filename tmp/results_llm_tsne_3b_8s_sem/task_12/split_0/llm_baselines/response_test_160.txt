Class: 0 | Reasoning: The query point is located near the cluster of points representing class 0 in the t-SNE visualization. The pie chart shows that the nearest neighbors (connected by red lines) are all from class 0, with the majority (75%) being within a smaller average distance (17.42). This suggests that the query point is more likely to belong to class 0 based on both the spatial clustering and the nearest neighbor analysis.
