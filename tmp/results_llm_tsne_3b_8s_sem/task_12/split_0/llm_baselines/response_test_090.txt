Class: 4 | Reasoning: The query point is closer to the class 4 cluster in the t-SNE visualization and has 4 neighbors from class 4, with the smallest average distance of 15.00. This indicates that the query point is most similar to class 4 based on both spatial proximity and the explicit nearest neighbor analysis.
