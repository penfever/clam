Looking at thisenhanced t-SNE visualization of tabular data, you can see:

1. Colored points representing training data, where each color corresponds to a different class
2. Gray square points representing test data  
3. One red star point which is the query point I want you to classify
4. A pie chart showing the distribution of the 1 nearest neighbors by class
5. The pie chart includes class counts, percentages, and average distances to neighbors

Class Legend:
- won: Blue RGB(30, 119, 181)
- nowin: Orange RGB(255, 127, 12)

K-NN Analysis (k=1):
â€¢ nowin: 1 neighbors (100%), AvgDist: 7.68

Dataset Context: Tabular data embedded using appropriate features 
Dataset: Chess endgame dataset representing King+Rook versus King+Pawn positions. Contains 3,196 chess positions where White (with King and Rook) faces Black (with King and Pawn on a7, one square from promotion). The task is to classify whether White can force a win or if the position is drawn/lost. | Key features: bkblk: Whether the black king is blocked from moving to certain squares; bknwy: Whether the black king is not in white's way to the promotion square; bkon8: Whether the black king is positioned on the 8th rank; bkona: Whether the black king is positioned on the a-file; bkspr: Whether the black king has spare moves or space to maneuver | Classes: "won"; "nowin"
IMPORTANT: The pie chart shows the class distribution of the 1 nearest neighbors found in the original high-dimensional embedding space, NOT just based on the 2D visualization space. Smaller average distances indicate higher similarity.

Based on BOTH the spatial position in the t-SNE visualization AND the explicit nearest neighbor connections, which class should this query point belong to?

Consider:
- The spatial clustering patterns in the t-SNE visualization
- Which classes the nearest neighbors (connected by red lines) belong to
- The relative importance of close neighbors (thicker lines)

Please respond with just the class label (e.g., "won", "nowin", etc.) followed by a brief explanation of your reasoning based on the spatial clustering AND the pie chart neighbor analysis.

Format your response as: "Class: [class_label] | Reasoning: [brief explanation]"
