Class: nowin | Reasoning: The query point is surrounded by points of the "nowin" class in the t-SNE visualization, and the pie chart shows that the nearest neighbors are all from the "nowin" class, with an average distance of 7.14. This suggests that the query point is more similar to the "nowin" class than the "won" class.
