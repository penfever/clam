Class: won | Reasoning: The query point is closer to the "won" class neighbors (blue points) in the t-SNE visualization. The pie chart shows that the nearest neighbors (1 neighbor) are all from the "won" class, with an average distance of 3.75, indicating high similarity. This suggests that the query point is more likely to belong to the "won" class.
