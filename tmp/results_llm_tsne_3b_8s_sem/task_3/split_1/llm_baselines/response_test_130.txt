Class: won | Reasoning: The query point is closer to the "won" class neighbors in the t-SNE visualization, and the pie chart shows that the nearest neighbor is also from the "won" class, with a smaller average distance (4.57). This suggests that the query point is more similar to the "won" class than the "nowin" class.
