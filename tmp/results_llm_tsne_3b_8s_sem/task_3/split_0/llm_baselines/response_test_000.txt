Class: won | Reasoning: The query point is closer to the "won" class neighbors in the t-SNE visualization, and the pie chart shows that the nearest neighbor is also from the "won" class, with a 100% count and a smaller average distance (55.96). This indicates a higher similarity to the "won" class, supporting the classification of the query point as "won".
