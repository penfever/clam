Class: nowin | Reasoning: The query point is closer to the "nowin" class neighbors (100% of the nearest neighbors are "nowin") and the average distance to these neighbors is 15.15, which is relatively close. The spatial clustering in the t-SNE visualization also suggests that the query point is more aligned with the "nowin" class.
