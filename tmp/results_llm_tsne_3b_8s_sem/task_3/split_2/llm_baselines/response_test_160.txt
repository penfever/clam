Class: nowin | Reasoning: The query point is closer to the "nowin" class neighbors (100% nowin) and has a smaller average distance (12.81) compared to the "won" class neighbors. The spatial clustering in the t-SNE visualization also suggests that the query point is more aligned with the "nowin" class.
