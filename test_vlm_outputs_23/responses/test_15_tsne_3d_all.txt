Class: Class_1 | Reasoning: The red star (query point) is closest to the orange-colored training points across all four viewing angles. This suggests that the query point is more similar to the training data from Class_1 than to the other classes.

=== RESPONSE ===

Class: Class_0 | Reasoning: The red star (query point) is closest to the blue-colored training points in all four views, indicating that it is embedded within the cluster of Class_0 data.

=== RESPONSE ===

Class: Class_2 | Reasoning: The red star (query point) is closest to the green-colored training points across all viewing angles, indicating that it is embedded within the cluster of Class_2 data.
