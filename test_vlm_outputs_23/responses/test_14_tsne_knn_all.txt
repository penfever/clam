=== RESPONSE ===

Class: Class_1 | Reasoning: The query point is closer to the test points of Class_1 than to the other classes. Additionally, the pie chart shows that Class_1 has the highest average distance to its nearest neighbors, indicating that it is more distinct from the other classes.

=== RESPONSE ===

Class: Class_0 | Reasoning: The query point is surrounded by neighbors from Class_0, and the pie chart shows that all 5 nearest neighbors are from Class_0, with an average distance of 3.6, indicating high similarity.

=== RESPONSE ===

Class: Class_1 | Reasoning: The query point is closer to the cluster of Class_1 neighbors (3 neighbors) compared to Class_2 neighbors (2 neighbors). Additionally, the average distance to Class_1 neighbors (4.8) is lower than to Class_2 neighbors (6.4), indicating higher similarity.

=== RESPONSE ===

Class: Class_1 | Reasoning: The query point is closer to the test point and the nearest neighbors are from Class_1, with a higher average distance to neighbors from Class_0.

=== RESPONSE ===

Class: Class_0 | Reasoning: The query point is surrounded by neighbors from Class_0, and the pie chart shows that all 5 nearest neighbors are from Class_0, with an average distance of 4.4. This indicates that the query point is more similar to the neighbors from Class_0 than to the neighbors from Class_1 or Class_2.

=== RESPONSE ===

Class: Class_1 | Reasoning: The query point is closer to the cluster of Class_1 neighbors (4 neighbors) than to the cluster of Class_2 neighbors (1 neighbor). Additionally, the average distance to Class_1 neighbors (6.1) is slightly lower than to Class_2 neighbors (5.2), indicating higher similarity to Class_1.

=== RESPONSE ===

Class: Class_0 | Reasoning: The query point is closer to the cluster of Class_0 neighbors (2 neighbors with an average distance of 6.4) compared to the other classes. The pie chart also shows that Class_0 has the highest count of neighbors among the three classes.

=== RESPONSE ===

Class: Class_0 | Reasoning: The query point is close to the majority of its nearest neighbors, which are all from Class_0. The pie chart shows that all 5 nearest neighbors are from Class_0, with an average distance of 15.9, indicating high similarity.

=== RESPONSE ===

Class: Class_2 | Reasoning: The query point is closer to the cluster of Class_2 neighbors in the t-SNE visualization, and the pie chart shows that Class_2 has the highest percentage of neighbors (80%) among the 5 nearest neighbors.

=== RESPONSE ===

Class: Class_0 | Reasoning: The query point is closer to the cluster of Class_0 neighbors in the t-SNE visualization, and the pie chart shows that Class_0 has the highest number of neighbors (3 out of 5) with the smallest average distance (5.3). This indicates that the query point is more similar to the Class_0 neighbors than to the Class_2 neighbors.

=== RESPONSE ===

Class: Class_2 | Reasoning: The query point is closer to the cluster of Class_2 neighbors in the t-SNE visualization, and the pie chart shows that Class_2 has the highest number of neighbors (4 out of 5) with the smallest average distance (5.6). This indicates that the query point is more similar to the Class_2 neighbors than to the Class_1 neighbors.

=== RESPONSE ===

Class: Class_1 | Reasoning: The query point is closer to the cluster of Class_1 neighbors (3 neighbors with an average distance of 5.9) than to the other classes. The pie chart also shows that Class_1 has the highest percentage of neighbors (60%) among the 5 nearest neighbors.

=== RESPONSE ===

Class: Class_0 | Reasoning: The query point is closer to the cluster of Class_0 neighbors in the t-SNE visualization, and the pie chart shows that Class_0 has the highest number of neighbors (3 out of 5) with the smallest average distance (5.2). This indicates that the query point is more similar to the Class_0 neighbors than to the Class_2 neighbors.

=== RESPONSE ===

Class: Class_1 | Reasoning: The query point is closer to the test points of Class_1 (average distance of 6.2) compared to Class_2 (average distance of 5.7). Additionally, the nearest neighbors of the query point are all from Class_1, which is visually supported by the t-SNE visualization where the query point is near the cluster of Class_1 points.

=== RESPONSE ===

Class: Class_0 | Reasoning: The query point is surrounded by neighbors from Class_0, and the pie chart shows that all 5 nearest neighbors are from Class_0, with an average distance of 10.1, indicating high similarity.
