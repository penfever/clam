Class: Class_1 | Reasoning: The red star is consistently closest to the cluster of points representing "Class_1" across all three visualization methods (PCA, T-SNE, UMAP). This suggests that the query point is most likely to belong to "Class_1" based on the spatial relationships and cluster assignments across the different methods.

=== RESPONSE ===

Class: Class_2 | Reasoning: The red star is consistently closest to the green-colored class clusters across all three visualization methods (PCA, T-SNE, UMAP). This suggests that the query point is most similar to the data points in Class_2, as it is consistently placed near the green-colored class in all three plots.
