Class: Class_1 | Reasoning: The red star is consistently closest to the cluster of points representing "Class_1" across all three visualization methods (T-SNE, ISOMAP, MDS). This suggests that the query point is most likely to belong to "Class_1" based on the spatial relationships and patterns observed in the data across these different visualization techniques.

Class: Class_2 | Reasoning: The red star is consistently closest to the green-colored class clusters across all three visualization methods (T-SNE, ISOMAP, MDS). This suggests that the query point is most likely to belong to "Class_2" based on the spatial relationships and patterns observed in the data across these different representations.

Class: Class_2 | Reasoning: The red star is consistently closest to the green-colored class points across all three visualization methods (T-SNE, ISOMAP, MDS). This suggests that the query point is most similar to the data points in Class_2, as it is the only class that appears to be the most central or representative in all three visualizations.
