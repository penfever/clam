Class: Class_1 | Reasoning: The red star is consistently closest to the "Class_1" cluster across all three visualization methods (PCA, T-SNE, SPECTRAL). This indicates that the query point is most similar to the data points in "Class_1" in terms of both linear relationships (PCA) and the underlying manifold structure (SPECTRAL). The T-SNE visualization also shows that "Class_1" is the most central cluster, suggesting that the query point is most likely to belong to "Class_1".

Class: Class_1 | Reasoning: The red star is consistently closest to the cluster of points representing Class_1 across all three visualization methods (PCA, T-SNE, SPECTRAL). This suggests that the query point is most likely to belong to Class_1 based on the spatial relationships and patterns observed in the data across these different representations.
