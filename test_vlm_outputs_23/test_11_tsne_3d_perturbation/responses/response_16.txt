Class: Long-term methods | Reasoning: The red star (query point) is closest to the orange-colored points, which represent the "Long-term methods" class. Across all viewing angles, the red star is more aligned with the "Long-term methods" cluster than with the "Short-term methods" or "No-use" clusters. This spatial proximity suggests that the query point is more representative of the "Long-term methods" class.
