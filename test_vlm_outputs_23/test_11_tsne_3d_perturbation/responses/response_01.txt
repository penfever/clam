Class: No-use | Reasoning: The red star (query point) is closest to the blue-colored "No-use" class across all viewing angles. In the isometric view, the red star is near the blue points, indicating a strong spatial clustering with the "No-use" class. Similarly, in the front, side, and top views, the red star is positioned near the blue points, reinforcing the classification.
