Class: Class_2 | Reasoning: The red star is consistently closest to the green-colored class clusters across all three visualization methods (PCA, t-SNE, ISOMAP). This suggests that the query point is most likely associated with Class_2. The consistent clustering in multiple methods indicates a strong pattern that aligns with the query point's classification.
