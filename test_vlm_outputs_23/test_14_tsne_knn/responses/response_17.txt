Class: Class_0 | Reasoning: The query point is closer to the cluster of Class_0 neighbors in the t-SNE visualization, and the pie chart shows that Class_0 has the highest number of neighbors (3 out of 5) with the smallest average distance (5.2). This indicates that the query point is more similar to the Class_0 neighbors than to the Class_2 neighbors.
