Class: Class_1 | Reasoning: The query point is closer to the test points of Class_1 (average distance of 6.2) compared to Class_2 (average distance of 5.7). Additionally, the nearest neighbors of the query point are all from Class_1, which is visually supported by the t-SNE visualization where the query point is near the cluster of Class_1 points.
