Class: Class_2 | Reasoning: The red star (query point) is consistently closest to the green-colored class clusters across both PCA and DECISION-SVC visualizations. In PCA, the red star is positioned near the green class cluster, indicating a higher similarity to Class_2. In DECISION-SVC, the red star is also near the green class cluster, suggesting that Class_2 is the most likely class for the query point. The other methods (Class_0 and Class_1) do not show as strong a clustering effect around the red star, making Class_2 the most reliable classification based on the multi-visualization analysis.
