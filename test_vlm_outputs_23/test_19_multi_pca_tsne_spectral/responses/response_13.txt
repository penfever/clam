Class: Class_1 | Reasoning: The red star is consistently closest to the "Class_1" cluster across all three visualization methods (PCA, T-SNE, SPECTRAL). This indicates that the query point is most similar to the data points in "Class_1" in terms of both linear relationships and manifold structure, making it the most likely class for the query point.
