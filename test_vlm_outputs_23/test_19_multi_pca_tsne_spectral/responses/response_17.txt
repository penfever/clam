Class: Class_1 | Reasoning: The red star is consistently closest to the "Class_1" colored points across all three visualization methods (PCA, T-SNE, SPECTRAL). This indicates that the query point is most similar to the "Class_1" data points in the underlying data structure, suggesting that "Class_1" is the most likely class for the query point.
