Class: Class_1 | Reasoning: The red star is consistently closest to the class_1 cluster across both PCA and FREQUENT-PATTERNS visualizations. In the PCA plot, the red star is near the class_1 cluster in the lower right quadrant. In the FREQUENT-PATTERNS plot, the red star is near the class_1 cluster in the middle of the support vs. length plot. Both visualizations suggest that the red star belongs to class_1.
