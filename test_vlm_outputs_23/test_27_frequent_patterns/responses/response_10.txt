Class: Class_1 | Reasoning: The red star is consistently closest to the class_1 cluster across both PCA and FREQUENT-PATTERNS visualizations. In the PCA plot, the red star is positioned near the class_1 cluster, indicating a higher density of data points in that area. In the FREQUENT-PATTERNS plot, the red star is near the class_1 frequent patterns, suggesting a higher frequency of patterns associated with class_1. Both visualizations indicate that class_1 is the most likely class for the query point.
