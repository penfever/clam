Class: Class_1 | Reasoning: The red star is consistently closest to the cluster of points representing "Class_1" across all four visualization methods. This is evident in the PCA, T-SNE, SPECTRAL, and ISOMAP plots, where the red star is positioned near the center of the "Class_1" cluster. The spatial relationships and patterns across these methods suggest that the query point is most likely associated with "Class_1."
