Class: No-use | Reasoning: The red star is consistently closest to the class labeled "No-use" across both PCA and t-SNE visualizations. In PCA, the red star is near the "No-use" class points, and in t-SNE, it is near the "No-use" class points as well. This consistency across different visualization methods suggests that the red star is most likely associated with the "No-use" class.
