Class: Class_2 | Reasoning: The red star is consistently closest to the green-colored class points across all three visualization methods (PCA, T-SNE, UMAP). This suggests that the query point is most likely associated with Class_2. The consistent clustering of the red star in the green class region across different methods indicates a strong alignment with this class, making it the most probable classification.
