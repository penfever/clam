Looking at this 3D t-SNE visualization of tabular data, you can see:

1. Colored points representing training data, where each color corresponds to a different class
2. Gray square points representing test data  
3. One red star point which is the query point I want you to classify
4. Four different views of the same 3D space: Isometric, Front (XZ), Side (YZ), and Top (XY)

Dataset Context: Test dataset with 3 classes

Based on the position of the red star (query point) relative to the colored training points across ALL viewing angles, which class should this query point belong to? The available classes are: "Class_0", "Class_1", "Class_2"

Consider:
- The spatial relationships in 3D space by examining all four views
- Which colored class clusters the red star is closest to or embedded within

Please respond with just the class label (e.g., "Class_0", "Class_1", "Class_2") followed by a brief explanation of your reasoning based on the 3D spatial clustering patterns you observe across the multiple views.
