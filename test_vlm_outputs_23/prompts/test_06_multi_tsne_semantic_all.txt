Looking at these 2 different visualizations (PCA, T-SNE) of the same tabular classification data:

Each visualization shows:
1. Colored points representing training data, where each color corresponds to a different class
2. Gray square points representing test data  
3. One red star point which is the query point I want you to classify

The multiple visualizations provide different perspectives on the same underlying data structure:
- **PCA**: Shows linear relationships and directions of maximum variance
- **T-SNE**: t-SNE visualization

Dataset Context: Test dataset with 3 classes

Based on the position of the red star (query point) across ALL 2 visualization methods (PCA, T-SNE), which class should this query point belong to? The available classes are: "No-use", "Long-term methods", "Short-term methods"

Consider:
- The spatial relationships across all 2 visualization methods
- Which colored class clusters the red star is consistently closest to across multiple methods
- Patterns that appear in multiple visualizations (these are more reliable than method-specific patterns)
- How different visualization methods agree or disagree about the query point's classification

Please respond with just the class label (e.g., "No-use", "Long-term methods", etc.) followed by a brief explanation of your reasoning based on the multi-visualization analysis across 2 methods (PCA, T-SNE).
