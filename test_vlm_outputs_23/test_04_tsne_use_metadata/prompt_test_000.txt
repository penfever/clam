Looking at this t-SNE visualization of tabular data, you can see:

1. Colored points representing training data, where each color corresponds to a different class
2. Gray square points representing test data  
3. One red star point which is the query point I want you to classify

Class Legend:
- No-use: Blue RGB(30, 119, 181)
- Long-term methods: Orange RGB(255, 127, 12)
- Short-term methods: Green RGB(43, 160, 43)
- Test points: Light Gray RGB(211, 211, 211)

Dataset Context: Tabular data embedded using appropriate features 
Dataset: Contraceptive Method Choice dataset from the 1987 National Indonesia Contraceptive Prevalence Survey. Predicts contraceptive method choice of married women based on demographic and socio-economic characteristics. | Key features: Wife's age: Age of wife in years (numerical); Wife's education: Education level (1=low, 2, 3, 4=high); Husband's education: Education level (1=low, 2, 3, 4=high); Number of children ever born: Number of children (numerical); Wife's religion: Religion (0=Non-Islam, 1=Islam) | Classes: "1": No-use; "2": Long-term methods; "3": Short-term methods

Based on the position of the red star (query point) relative to the colored training points, which class should this query point belong to? The available classes are: "No-use", "Long-term methods", "Short-term methods"

Consider:
- The spatial relationships in the t-SNE visualization
- Which colored class clusters the red star is closest to or embedded within

Please respond with just the class label (e.g., "No-use", "Long-term methods", etc.) followed by a brief explanation of your reasoning based on the spatial clustering patterns you observe.

Format your response as: "Class: [class_label] | Reasoning: [brief explanation]"
