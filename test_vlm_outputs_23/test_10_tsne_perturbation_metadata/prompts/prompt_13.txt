Looking at this t-SNE visualization of tabular data, you can see:

1. Colored points representing training data, where each color corresponds to a different class
2. Gray square points representing test data  
3. One red star point which is the query point I want you to classify

Dataset Context: Test dataset with 3 classes

Based on the position of the red star (query point) relative to the colored training points, which class should this query point belong to? The available classes are: "No-use", "Long-term methods", "Short-term methods"

Consider:
- The spatial relationships in the t-SNE visualization
- Which colored class clusters the red star is closest to or embedded within

Please respond with just the class label (e.g., "No-use", "Long-term methods", etc.) followed by a brief explanation of your reasoning based on the spatial clustering patterns you observe.

Format your response as: "Class: [class_label] | Reasoning: [brief explanation]"
